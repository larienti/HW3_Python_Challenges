I did these assignments in Jupyter Notebook. Upon conversion to .py from .ipynb there was some unsightly formatting occurring. I decided instead to include two files for each of my solutions. There is a .py file with the raw python code pasted inside and a .ipynb with the actual code that I ran inside Jupyter notebook to generate my text file. 

Happy python!
